Atliq Grands, a prominent player in the Indian hospitality sector for two decades, faces challenges in market share and revenue loss.
Competitor strategies and management inefficiencies contribute to declining performance in luxury/business hotels.

However, lacking an in-house data analytics team, Atliq Grands plans to engage a third-party service provider for insights from historical data.
